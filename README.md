# practice-web-api-security

## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial has two important sides:
  * It shows the Token Based Authentication using OWIN middleware pipeline with ASP.NET Web Api 2. This is mostly a copy of an already existing **GREAT** tutorial provided by [Taiseer Joudeh](https://github.com/tjoudeh) called [AngularJSAuthentication](https://github.com/tjoudeh/AngularJSAuthentication). You can also find more about it on his blog [here](http://bitoftech.net/2014/06/01/token-based-authentication-asp-net-web-api-2-owin-asp-net-identity/)
  * It wants to provide integration with a really cool open-source project hosted here on GitHub called [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer)
  * It also provides the foundation for me to play with these technologies and code mentioned above and to input some of my own thoughts
